The original version is at https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hackbar/

Current release version is 1.0.4 at https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-hackbar/

This is first version, there will definitely be some of bugs, please don't hate me and give me any bugs and comments to improve it.

## Some features now:
1. Almost of features and gui in this version is based on the original addon (hackbar).
2. The importance changes are this version is written in webextension technology in stead of the XUL technology in the original version. The original version is best but if you want to use the hackbar in firefox > 57 (Quantum), you must use this version. The XUL addon is not supported anymore.
3. I tried to make this version as similar as possible to the original. However, due to the new policy of firefox 
version, the position of the new hackbar must move to devtools-panel.
4. Most of core functions is completed. I am trying to port all of them. If anyone who have any idea about the layout, please contact me.
